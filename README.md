\f3\b0\fs32 \cf4 \cb5 Social media has become an essential part of political campaigns and can influence the political discourse. However, monitoring and analyzing vast amounts of data is challenging. \
\
The TRIADS and Metabase are two tools that can help in this regard. In this case study, we'll explore how the TRIADS team at Washington University in St. Louis used CrowdTangle, TRIADS, and Metabase to analyze data related to election campaigns.\cb1 \

\f4\b\fs48 \cf6 \cb5 CrowdTangle: Social Media Analytics Tool\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs32 \cf4 \cb5 CrowdTangle is a social media analytics tool that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of public content on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit. Jacob Montgomery, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, uses CrowdTangle to track and analyze social media activity related to election campaigns, candidates, and issues.\cb1 \
\cb5 By using CrowdTangle, Montgomery can monitor mentions of candidates and political parties, track hashtags and keywords, and identify emerging trends and patterns in social media activity related to elections.\cb1 \

\f4\b\fs48 \cf6 \cb5 TRIADS: Text Analytics Tool\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs32 \cf4 \cb5 TRIADS (Text Retrieval and Integration for Data Science) is a text analytics tool developed by the TRIADS team at Washington University in St. Louis. Montgomery used TRIADS to process CrowdTangle data and extract meaningful information.\cb1 \
\cb5 TRIADS uses a hybrid approach combining both rule-based and machine learning techniques to extract and analyze data. This allows Montgomery to extract and analyze a wide range of data related to election campaigns.\cb1 \

\f4\b\fs48 \cf6 \cb5 Metabase: Business Intelligence and Analytics Tool\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs32 \cf4 \cb5 Metabase is a business intelligence and analytics tool that Montgomery used to turn the data he collected through CrowdTangle and TRIADS into dynamic dashboards. By using Metabase, Montgomery can visualize his data and gain deeper insights into the electoral landscape.\cb1 \
\cb5 Using Metabase, Montgomery created custom dashboards that helped him track key metrics related to the electoral landscape, such as engagement levels, sentiment, and other relevant data. He also used Metabase's interactive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to gain a deeper understanding of the data he had collected.\cb1 \

\f4\b\fs48 \cf6 \cb5 Benefits\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs32 \cf4 \cb5 By using CrowdTangle, TRIADS, and Metabase, the TRIADS team and Montgomery could gain a deeper understanding of the electoral landscape and make informed predictions about election outcomes. They could monitor social media activity in real-time, understand the public's response to different candidates, issues, and campaign messages, and identify emerging trends and patterns. This information could be used to inform research and analysis of the electoral landscape and help journalists, policymakers, and the public better understand the political climate and make informed decisions.\cb1 \
