### Transforming Election Data into Actionable and Dynamic Dashboards

Introduction
Social media has become an essential part of political campaigns and can influence the political discourse. 
However, monitoring and analyzing vast amounts of data is challenging. 
In this project the <a href="https://triads.wustl.edu"  [TRIADS] () development team takes existing CrowdTangle election data and transforms it into dynamic dashboards.  

#CrowdTangle: Social Media Analytics Tool

CrowdTangle is a social media analytics tool that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of public content on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit. Jacob Montgomery, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, uses CrowdTangle to track and analyze social media activity related to election campaigns, candidates, and issues.

By using CrowdTangle, Montgomery can monitor mentions of candidates and political parties, track hashtags and keywords, and identify emerging trends and patterns in social media activity related to elections.

TRIADS: Text Analytics Tool

TRIADS (Text Retrieval and Integration for Data Science) is a text analytics tool developed by the TRIADS team at Washington University in St. Louis. Montgomery used TRIADS to process CrowdTangle data and extract meaningful information.

TRIADS uses a hybrid approach combining both rule-based and machine learning techniques to extract and analyze data. This allows Montgomery to extract and analyze a wide range of data related to election campaigns.

Metabase: Business Intelligence and Analytics Tool

Metabase is a business intelligence and analytics tool that Montgomery used to turn the data he collected through CrowdTangle and TRIADS into dynamic dashboards. By using Metabase, Montgomery can visualize his data and gain deeper insights into the electoral landscape.

Using Metabase, Montgomery created custom dashboards that helped him track key metrics related to the electoral landscape, such as engagement levels, sentiment, and other relevant data. He also used Metabase's interactive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to gain a deeper understanding of the data he had collected.

Benefits

By using CrowdTangle, TRIADS, and Metabase, the TRIADS team and Montgomery could gain a deeper understanding of the electoral landscape and make informed predictions about election outcomes. They could monitor social media activity in real-time, understand the public's response to different candidates, issues, and campaign messages, and identify emerging trends and patterns. This information could be used to inform research and analysis of the electoral landscape and help journalists, policymakers, and the public better understand the political climate and make informed decisions.

Conclusion

Tools like CrowdTangle, TRIADS, and Metabase offer a powerful way to monitor and analyze social media activity related to elections. By using these tools, experts like Montgomery and the TRIADS team can gain real-time insights into the electoral landscape, identify emerging trends and patterns, and make informed predictions about election outcomes.
